Game Streaming a very straight forward and do not bring that much feature that expands other time of user and content creator. They just focus and streaming.

The solution is to bring some features that most users can enjoy while watching their favorite game. Make thing extends a little more for more people.

## TARGET MARKET
Male from 25 to 35 like a complex game but, not much time to learn them. Traits: Simple lay back person, does not like exposure, and is a collector. Features he may like are to follow other users and to get similar content.
Female from 15 to 25. She is an otaku and enjoys anime a lot but, is not big in gaming. Trait: She is outgoing,  and likes its cell. Features she may like are a search that considers her likes and can expand more depending on her liking.

Links will pick content and other users from your likes and present you fresh content every time.
Sider lets you see two videos at the same time side by side so you can compare them.
Critics are the comment section but, only very pro gamers can comment making sure game-driven comments apply.
## COMPETITORS
TWITCH may focus is on live streaming and very straightforward.
YOUTUBE GAMING is just youtube with a gaming twist and I feel it should be a little more different.
BIGO LIVE is very similar to my idea and it feels like my main competitor. Features are different but do bring more to the table.
AFREECA is very similar to TWITCH as they both are more live streaming driven.
AZUBU is the one lacking more features and ideas. I like a weaker version of YOUTUBE GAMING.
