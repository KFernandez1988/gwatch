# COMPETITORS
TWITCH may focus is on live streaming and very straightforward.
YOUTUBE GAMING is just youtube with a gaming twist and I feel it should be a little more different.
BIGO LIVE is very similar to my idea and it feels like my main competitor. Features are different but do bring more to the table.
AFREECA is very similar to TWITCH as they both are more live streaming driven.
AZUBU is the one lacking more features and ideas. I like a weaker version of YOUTUBE GAMING.
